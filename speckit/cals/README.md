# Speckit Cals

A project implementing a calculator application using Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

## Overview

Speckit Cals is a calculator application built with a focus on specification-driven development. The project follows a structured approach where specifications guide the development process, ensuring clear requirements and maintainable code.

## Project Structure

- `.specify/` - Contains specification templates, scripts, and memory
- `specs/1-calculator-app/` - Specification files for the calculator application
- `history/` - Stores prompt history records and architectural decision records
- `.qwen/` - Qwen Code configuration and command files

## Features

- Calculator functionality (details specified in the calculator app spec)
- Spec-driven development approach
- Automated prompt history recording
- Architectural decision tracking

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes the Qwen Code framework for implementing a specification-driven development workflow, but the specific technology stack for the calculator application implementation is defined in the feature specifications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Explore the specifications in the `specs/` directory
3. Follow the implementation guidelines as specified in the respective feature specs

## Contributing

This project follows the Spec-Driven Development methodology. All contributions should adhere to the established specification and implementation patterns defined in the project structure.
