## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I see that you've provided the specification template again, but I still haven't received a specific feature description to work with. The $ARGUMENTS placeholder is empty, which means there's no feature description for me to turn into a specification.

To proceed with creating a feature specification, I need you to provide the actual feature description. For example, you might tell me:

- "Create a user profile management system"
- "Add search functionality to the document repository"
- "Implement OAuth2 authentication for the API"
- "Create a dashboard to visualize user analytics"

Please provide the feature description you'd like me to specify, and I'll follow the complete process you've outlined to create a detailed specification for it.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified missing feature description requirement
- 🧪 Tests: 
- 📁 Files: 
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide feature description
- 🧠 Reflection: Command needs feature description to proceed

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
